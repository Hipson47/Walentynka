# Accessibility (A11y) Standards

Ensuring the application is usable by everyone, including keyboard and screen reader users.

## Interactive Elements

- **Accessible Names**: Every button/link must have a text label or `aria-label`. Icon-only buttons are FORBIDDEN without labels.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements must be reachable via `Tab`. Use native `<button>` and `<a>` tags.
- **Focus Indicators**: Never remove focus outlines without providing a high-visibility CSS alternative.
- **Aria-Hidden**: Use `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative icons and illustrations.

## Modals & Overlays

- **Focus Trapping**: Modals MUST trap focus within their bounds while open.
- **Escape Key**: All overlays must close on `Escape`.
- **Focus Restoration**: Return focus to the trigger element when a modal closes.
- **Semantics**: Use `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` for modal containers.

## Visual & Motion

- **Contrast**: Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text.
- **Motion Control**: Non-essential animations must be disabled if `prefers-reduced-motion` is active.
- **Color Independence**: Do not convey meaning through color alone (e.g., error states should have icons or text).
