# Debugging & Verification Protocol

A disciplined approach to identifying root causes and verifying fixes before claiming completion.

## Systematic Debugging (Phase 1-4)

1. **Root Cause First**: NEVER attempt a fix without understanding the root cause. Read error messages and stack traces completely.
2. **Reproduce**: Ensure the issue can be reliably reproduced before attempting changes.
3. **Hypothesize**: Form a single, clear hypothesis ("X is failing because Y") and test it minimally.
4. **Fix & Verify**: Implement the fix and verify it immediately. If 3+ attempts fail, stop and re-evaluate the architecture.

## Verification Gate (The Iron Law)

**NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE.**

Before claiming a task is done:
- **Identify**: What command or manual check proves success?
- **Run**: Execute the command (e.g., `npm run build`, `npm run dev`).
- **Read**: Check for exit codes, error counts, and specific success messages.
- **Confirm**: Only state "Success" if the evidence supports it.

## Common Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify build integrity
npm run build

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Verify dev server start
npm run dev
```

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Using words like "should", "probably", or "seems to work".
- ❌ Claiming success based on a previous run or "obvious" fix.
- ❌ Ignoring linter warnings or minor console errors.
