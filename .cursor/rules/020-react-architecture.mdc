# React Architecture

## What to do

- Keep state transitions in reducer flow (`src/app/state.ts` + `useReducer` in `src/app/App.tsx`).
- Keep screen-level rendering in `src/views` and reusable building blocks in `src/components`.
- Keep animation/effect logic in `src/effects` and hooks in `src/hooks`.
- Keep copy and asset paths centralized in `src/config/valentine.config.ts`.

## Don't do

- Do not move reducer transitions into view components.
- Do not duplicate config text/assets across multiple files.
- Do not mix screen orchestration with low-level effect implementation.
