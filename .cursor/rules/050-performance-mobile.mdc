# Performance (Mobile First)

## What to do

- Set explicit caps for particles and spawn intervals.
- Prefer transform/opacity updates over layout-affecting animation properties.
- Minimize layout thrash (avoid read/write/read loops in tight handlers).
- Keep decorative fullscreen overlays non-interactive (`pointer-events: none`).
- Validate on small viewport and reduced-motion paths before finalizing.

## Don't do

- Do not allow unbounded particle growth or unthrottled pointer churn.
- Do not assume desktop smoothness implies mobile smoothness.
- Do not ignore reduced-motion behavior for continuous effects.
