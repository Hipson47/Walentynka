description: Validation format for writing Cursor .mdc rule files
globs: "**/*.mdc"
alwaysApply: false

# MDC Rule Format

## What to do

- Start each `.mdc` with YAML frontmatter.
- Include `description` and either `alwaysApply: true` or scoped `globs`.
- Keep rules short, actionable, and repository-specific.

## Don't do

- Do not omit frontmatter fields.
- Do not mix legacy `.cursorrules` style blocks into `.mdc`.

## Template

```md
---
description: Short rule intent
globs: "src/**/*.tsx"
alwaysApply: false
---

# Rule Title

- Actionable instruction
```
